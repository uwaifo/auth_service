# IAM

### CONCEPT
we're going to have scopes that contains permissions.
A specific scope will have a list of permissions which authorizes the performance of a required action.

for instance, when the user tries to create a team within an organisation:
    - The user must have a scope
    - the scope must have a permission that permits the specific action required by the user.
    
From the definition above, we can think of a scope as a grouping of closely related actions.
Where the permissions are the actions allowable within the scope.

With this is mind, a user with a specific scope can only perform actions allowable within the scope.
To perform more actions the user must have more scopes with the requisite actions
